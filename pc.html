				<h1 class="tcenter">Preferred Customer Details</h1>
				<p class="topSpacing">Before you jump in, I want to explain a few things. Being a Preferred Customer is how I started. I signed up because I'm cheap and it was the cheapest way to get started. Here are some things you should know as a Preferred Customer.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Most people do really well with just the Fundamentals Pack and VitaGBX</li>
					<li>If you're struggling with something specific, there's a <a class="link purple" href="https://www.amare.com/corporate/shop-all" target="_blank">line of other products</a> that you may need, to at least help you get going. Personally, I started with The Fundamentals and Mood+ for added anxiety support. I later added Probiotics and Digestive to help heal my stomach.</li>
					<li>You'll want to make a <strong>"Subscribe &amp; Save"</strong> order, to get the best deal. Preferred Customers earn a FREE product when they place their first "Subscribe &amp; Save" order of $39.95 or more. You can edit or delete the subscription at any time, but it's convenient to have, so you can get your products each month without having to remember.</li>
					<li>Amare has a <strong>"Bundle and Save"</strong> option, when you choose one of their packs, you can add on up to 3 other products at a deep discount! This has been awesome and I use it every month.</li>
					<li>Shipping is a flat $4.99. How cool is that!?</li>
					<li>You'll want to make sure you give the products a good 3-4 months, before deciding if it's for you. Several of the ingredients are adaptogenic and need 4 to 6 weeks to build up in your system. Healing takes time and there may be many issues you don't even know about, that need to be resolved.</li>
					<li>As a Preferred Customer, you can <strong>earn free product</strong> when you refer a friend that also joins and places a "Subscribe &amp; Save" order.</li>
				</ul>
